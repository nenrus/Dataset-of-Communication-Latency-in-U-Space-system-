This dataset is the result of experiment in U-Space communication comparing push-pull protocol and publisher-subscriber protocols. 

At the beginning, it compares the REST-API (Representational State Transfer - Application Program Interface) and AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol). The result was presented at the 1st International Conference on Drones and Unmanned Systems (DAUS' 2025), 19-21 February 2025 in Granada, Spain. You can watch the presentation video via this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSSktZhPtpE. The proceding with title: "Analysis of Communication Latency in U-Space system using Push-Pull and Publisher-Subscriber Protocols" can be found in this link: http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.18747.94240

Then, the research is extended to facilitate analysis of two more protocol which are ZeroMQ (ZMQ) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). It is published in the Electronics journal with DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics14122453.

The dataset is structured in CSV files consisting parameters: sending timestamp, received timestamp, latency, and acknowledgement message in 100 lines of data. The filename represent the interval and message size used in the experiment. It is categorized into protocols type folders, then datetime of the experiment. The python codes to run the experiments are also available here, but you need to update the link to use your own destination server and broker.

The research is part of AI4HyDrop project and supported by the SESAR 3 Joint Undertaking and its founding members and co-funded by the EUâ€™s research and innovation programme Horizon Europe under Grant Agreement no 101114805.
